Thankyou so much for opening this Readme...

This was my personal git and github tutorial repository. In this tutorial I tried to learn all the git commands that are useful for a developer while working on a project.
whether it is a personal project or it is a open source project. this repo is useful for them.
in this repo I have added a gitcommand.txt from where you can understand all commands with brief info. 

so all the best.....

"To show your learrning you can clone this repo and add your name and email to i_am_learning.txt
